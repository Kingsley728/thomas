<h2><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>
</h2>
<p>Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with <a href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>,
    <a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, and<a href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a>
    . For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the
        secret to writing a best-selling textbook</a> <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the
            secret to writing a best-selling textbook</a></p>


<p>are answers to a few frequently asked questions about 
<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>:</P>

<p><dt> <i>Will there be a fourth edition?  If so, when will it be available?</i>

</dt></P>

<p><dd> The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022.  The <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-fourth-edition">MIT Press site for the book</a> has links to sites that sell it.</P>

           </dd></P>

           <p><dt> <a name="errata"></a><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
  </dt><dd> For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
           page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by
           severity.</p>

           <p>

           For the second and third editions, we maintained an <a href="clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors
     by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer.  There is even
     an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the
     errors posted since the last date that you asked about.  We
     stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so
     that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.
</dd></P>

<p><dt> <i>How do I report errors?</i>
</dt><dd> First, please visit the <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
     page</a> to verify that the error has not been reported
     already.  Once you have determined that you have found an
     unreported error, send email to <a href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>.  We will
           respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.</p>

           <p>

           Please use the <a href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a> address
           <em>only</em> to report errors.  If you have a suggestion or a
           question, please contact me directly at <a href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">thc@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>.
           </dd></P>

           <p>
            <dt> <i>Do you correct errors?</i>
  </dt><dd> Yes.  Each time a new printing is produced, it contains
     corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time.
     The <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
     page</a> indicates in which printing each error was corrected.
     </dd></p>

     <p> <dt> <i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i>
</dt><dd> Each edition is a major revision of the book.  The first
     edition of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> was published in
     1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition
     appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022.  A
     printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to
     manufacture more copies.  As the answer to the previous
     question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each
     printing of the second and third editions.  We perturb the
     pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a
     new printing.</dd></P>

     <p><dt> <a name="solutions"></a><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and
     problems?</i>
  </dt></P>
  
  <p><dd> As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for
     a select set of exercises and problems.  They are posted at the
     MIT Press website.</P>
     
     <p>

     We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is
     available only to instructors who have adopted the book for
     course use.  The manual has lecture notes and solutions to
     additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them.
     (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and
     problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.)
     You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access
     the manual site and the files.  (Contact information is at the
     MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or
     from any of my coauthors.

     </p>
     <p>

     <strong>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for
     solutions.</strong>
</dd></P>

<p><dt> <i>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode
     in the book?</i></P>

 <p> </dt><dd> I created three packages for LaTeX2e.  The
     <code>clrscode</code> package gives you pseudocode in the style
     of the second edition, the <code>clrscode3e</code> package
     gives you pseudocode in the style of the third edition, and the
     <code>clrscode4e</code> package gives you pseudocode in the
     style of the fourth edition.</P>

           <p>

           You can download the <code>clrscode4e</code> package <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/clrscode4e.sty">here</a>
           and its documentation <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/clrscode4e.pdf">here</a>.

           </p>
           <p>

           You can download either
           <code>clrscode</code> or <code>clrscode3e</code> and its documentation by clicking <a href="clrscode">here</a>.  The <code>clrscode</code> package is
     also on the
     <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/?filename=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/&amp;preferredCTAN=tug.ctan.org&amp;action=/tools/filesearch&amp;catstring=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/">CTAN website</a>.
    </dd></P>

    <p><dt> <i>Can you send me a free copy of the book?  Can you send me
     an electronic copy of the book?  Can you help me with this
     algorithms problem I have?</i>
</dt></P>

<p><dd> No, no, and sorry, but no.  You can purchase an electronic copy
     of the book, however: Amazon.com now sells a version of
     <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> for Kindle.</P>
     </dd></P>

     <p><dt> <i>I see that there are two versions of the second edition,
     one published by the MIT Press and one published by McGraw-Hill.
     How do the two versions differ?</i>
    </dt></P>

    <p><dd> Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content
     in the two versions is identical.  McGraw-Hill also includes a CD
     (see the next question).
</dd></P>

<p><dt> <i>Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming
     language, rather than just pseudocode?</i>
</dt></P>

<p><dd> In the second edition, McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD
     containing Java implementations of all the algorithms in Parts
     I-VI.  The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that
     document all the classes.
     We did not update the Java implementations for the third
     edition.</P>  
     <p>

           For the fourth edition, we have made available on the MIT Press
           website <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/clrsPython.zip">implementations
           in Python</a> by Linda Xiao and me.
